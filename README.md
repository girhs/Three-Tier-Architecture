AWS offers extensive assets to fabricate and keep up with your cloud applications. These assets can be arranged to cooperate to make profoundly accessible, exceptionally solid cloud structures. The situation we will utilize is that you have been approached to plan and make a profoundly accessible 3 level design for your organisation's new web application.
What is a Three Tier Architecture
A Three Tier Architecture consists of :-
Presentation Tier, Application Tier, Data Tier.
The Presentation Tier is the user Interface, such as the website that a user or client navigates to. It can also be thought of as the "Front End."
The Application Tier is where data is processed and is often called the "Back End."
The Data Tier is where data is Stored and Managed.
Benefits of a Three Tier Architecture
Decreased development time - It allows different teams to work simultaneously on different Tiers, resulting in a Faster Deployment Process.
Increased scalability - A Tier can have an Auto-Scaling Group independent of other Tiers, meaning for each Tier, you only use what you need.
Increased reliability - Each Tier can have multiple resources in multiple availability zones and the success and availability of one tier is independent of the other tiers.
Increased security - Each Tier can have its own security group, allowing for custom Permissions depending on the needs of that Tier.
